Kor Testudo Shell
=================

Kor is an implementation of a desktop workspace, consisting of a desktop window, 'run command' dialog
and panel(s).


Configuration:
==============

Currently there is no configuration UI. Config file $KDEDIR/share/config/korrc is installed with
a default configuration, including comments in the config file. Create your own file
$KDEHOME/share/config/korrc based on it.


Replacing Plasma/KRunner:
=========================

KRunner currently is also reponsible for other workspace tasks (such as screensaver activation)
and should not be disabled. For replacing its 'run command' dialog with the one from Kor,
use the Global shortcuts module in System settings and assign the Alt+F2 shortcut to
the Kor Testudo Shell shortcut.

Plasma-desktop can be disabled when running Kor. Create file $KDEHOME/share/autostart/plasma-desktop.desktop
with two lines, '[Desktop Entry]' and 'Hidden=true'.
