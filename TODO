Short-term:
===========

- clean up config loading etc.
    - rename load() to loadConfig() and use for pure config load?
    - make applets etc. remember their id?
- panel background (fix plasma applets?)
    - plasma themeing seems to be broken
- klipper systray icon is not visible
- splash goes away before kor is ready (suspend/resume startup broken?)

Mid-term:
===========

- minicli on-the-fly parsing (for icon)
- change minicli to F2 (+handle reassigning from krunner)
- moving kscreenlocker etc. out of krunner
- initial panel layouting is visible, avoid/hide somehow
- API for native applets ?
- do not create panels/desktops that are on screens which do not exist
- how does plasma theme code decide whether to use transparent or opaque? (match with BackgroundColor=)

Long-term:
===========

- avoid modal dialogs
- QtScript for calculator?
- NET:KeepAbove and other WM handling (placement, activation)
- www history support
    - should be probably enabled first using a shortcut or something, so that it otherwise doesn't interfere
- check cost of plasma dependencies, possibly make optional
- somehow avoid all the annoying plasma applet animations
- UI for handling of applets (adding, etc.)
