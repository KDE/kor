Short-term:
===========

- calculator

Mid-term:
===========

- on-the-fly parsing (for icon)
- change minicli to F2 (+handle reassigning from krunner)
- moving kscreenlocker etc. out of krunner
- NET:KeepAbove and other WM handling (placement, activation)
- terminal support (check if it works, enable automatically for selected apps)
- www history support
    - should be probably enabled first using a shortcut or something, so that it otherwise doesn't interfere


Long-term:
===========

- avoid modal dialogs
