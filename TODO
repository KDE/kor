Short-term:
===========

- threads for minicli disabled for now, fast typing of a url leads to dbus deadlock
    - check the dbus patch from k-c-d
- minicli has broken positioning on xinerama (active vs inactive screen)
    - and launched apps are placed on the other screen
- splash still goes away way too soon

Mid-term:
===========

- klipper systray icon doesn't repaint when covered by a popup menu
- change minicli to F2 (+handle reassigning from krunner)
- moving kscreenlocker, startup notification, etc. out of krunner
- initial panel layouting is visible, avoid/hide somehow
- API for native applets ?
- do not create panels/desktops that are on screens which do not exist
- how does plasma theme code decide whether to use transparent or opaque? (match with BackgroundColor=)
- more complete color theming possible (not just background, but all kicker could do)
- clean up config loading etc.
    - rename load() to loadConfig() and use for pure config load?
    - make applets etc. remember their id?
    - use KConfigXT wherever possible
- icon (to be set as the window icon for panels, for example)

Long-term:
===========

- avoid modal dialogs
- QtScript for calculator?
- NET:KeepAbove and other WM handling (placement, activation)
- www history support
    - should be probably enabled first using a shortcut or something, so that it otherwise doesn't interfere
- check cost of plasma dependencies, possibly make optional
- somehow avoid all the annoying plasma applet animations
- UI for handling of applets (adding, etc.)
- allow stacking two panels at one edge, or use a grid layout for applets
