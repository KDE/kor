Short-term:
===========


Mid-term:
===========

- minicli on-the-fly parsing (for icon)
- change minicli to F2 (+handle reassigning from krunner)
- moving kscreenlocker etc. out of krunner
- is Kephal ABI stable?
- the distinction between Panel and PanelWindow - is it good, is it useful?
- initial panel layouting is visible, avoid/hide somehow
- API for native applets ?

Long-term:
===========

- avoid modal dialogs
- QtScript for calculator?
- NET:KeepAbove and other WM handling (placement, activation)
- www history support
    - should be probably enabled first using a shortcut or something, so that it otherwise doesn't interfere
- check cost of plasma dependencies, possibly make optional
- somehow avoid all the annoying plasma applet animations
- UI for handling of applets (adding, etc.)
